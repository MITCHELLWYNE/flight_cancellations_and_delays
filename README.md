A look into the cancellations and delays by airline, and the causes for those delays or cancellations

For our project we want to look into the flight cancellation and delay rate in the United States in 2022 since post pandemic people are traveling a lot now. Standing at a passenger’s point, we want to offer some insight to see if there would be a better choice in terms of airline, airport or month when travelling. 

#Home Page
In home page, we offer some general comparison between each airline, the performance is based in 2022. The first graph is the overall customer satisfaction study, we were not able to find a dataset, this data source is coming from J.D. Power 2022 North America Airline Satisfaction Study, numbers are based on a 1000-point scale. According to this study, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta are the top 3 performers, while Spirit, American airline, and Frontier are the bottom 3 performers.  
The second graph is the financial performance, the net income by airlines in 2022. According to this dataset, it’s interesting to see that Delta and Southwest which have the best performance in customer satisfaction rating also have the highest net income, while Spirit and American airline which have the lowest customer satisfaction rating also have a lowest net income. 
The last one in this page is a summary of delay rate by each airline, Allegaint, JetBlue, and Frontier have the highest delay rate, while Skywest, Endeavor, and Delta have the lowest delay rate. Although high delay rate doesn’t essentially cause low customer satisfaction or poor financial performance, we think it could be insightful to let our users to have this information.
